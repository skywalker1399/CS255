Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project had me acting as a system designer for a company that wated to make a website where students can take practice tests as well as set up sessions to work on their driving.


What did you do particularly well?

I was tasked with making multiple diagrams for the system and I think this is where I did sopme of my best work. By being able to show the system in a nontechnical way through a diagram means you can convey your informaiton to just about anybody.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

There was an assignment where I had to make a use case diagram for the system. My first thought was to make a digram for one of the use cases and so I did based on a student trying to reserve a car. I should have took it as makking a diagram for all usecases for the system. I revised it during my final project to better reflect the system as a whole.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Looking over the interview notes is important to finding out what the customer really wants out of their system. You want the customer ot be satisfied with the work you did so they might return in the future or even refer you to a friend.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would start by talking to the customer and figuring out what they are expecting from the system. Knowing what they want and having their feedback throught the steps helps keep the system on the right track. I would be sure to use use case diagrams and even activity diagrams to show the system as a whole and the flow of information.
